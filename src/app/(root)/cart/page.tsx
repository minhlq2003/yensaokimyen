Authored by Alan Stern, the mission's principal investigator, and David Grinspoon, an award-winning astrobiologist, this book takes readers behind the scenes of one of the most daring and groundbreaking space missions in history." +
        "The narrative unfolds over decades of vision, determination, and ingenuity, as a team of scientists and engineers overcame immense technical, political, and financial hurdles to accomplish what once seemed impossible. From New Horizons' launch in 2006 to its dramatic flyby of Pluto in 2015, the book captures the exhilaration of discovery, the tension of high-stakes science, and the profound impact of viewing a distant world up close for the first time." +
        "Rich with stunning images of Pluto and its moons, 'Chasing New Horizons' is more than just a chronicle of a mission—it’s an inspiring testament to human curiosity and the drive to explore the unknown.",
